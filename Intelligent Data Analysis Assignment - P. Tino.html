</font></h1>
</a>
<p>
<br>
You may chose any data set(s) from the list bellow, but finding your own dataset to investigate is much more preferable (and you'll be rewarded)! <br>
If you decide to go the easier route and use some of the data sets provided, un-tar the relevant file and go to the corresponding folder.<br>
The folder contains the data set, as well as additional information
about the data. Read the available information, especially
description of the features (data dimensions).<br>
You will need to clean the data, so that it contains
only numerical features (dimensions)
and the features are space-separated (not comma-separated).
<br>

<br>
To make the plots informative, you should
come up with a labelling scheme for data points.<br>
If the data can be classified into several classes
(find out in the data and feature description!), use that information
as the basis for your labelling scheme.
In that case exclude the class information
from the data dimensions.
<br>
Alternatively, you can make labels out of any dimension,
e.g. by quantising it into several intervals. For example,
if the data dimension represents age of a person,
you can quantise it into 5 labels (classes)
[child, teenager, young adult, middle age, old].<br>
Associate the data labels with different markers and
use the markers to show what kind of data points get projected
to different regions of the visualization plot
(computer screen).

<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li> 
Learn as much as you can about the chosen data set using the PCA method
developed in the module.
</li>
<li> 
Be creative - use various data labelling schemes (not just one)! 
</li>
</ul>


<br><br>
<h2><font color="#008000">Report
</font></h2>
In the report describe:
<ul>
- the data (15%) <br>
- how you preprocessed the data and why (15%) <br>
- What features (coordinates) did you use for labelling the
  projected points with different markers? What questions on the data did ask/investigate. (20%) <br>
- How did you design the labelling schemes? (10%) <br>   
- What interesting aspects of the data did you detect
  based on the data visualisations? (20%) <br>
- What interesting aspects of the data did you detect
  based on  eigenvector and eigenvalue analysis of the data covariance matrix? (20%) 
<br>
</ul>

<br>
You should demonstrate that you:
<ul>
- understand the data analysis techniques used<br>
- are able to extract useful information about otherwise
  inconceivable high-dimensional data using 
  PCA
</ul>

<br>
<font color="#800000">Please note that you will be marked solely based on how well you used the techniques presented in the course on your data. If your data cannot be reasonably explained in 2 or 3 dimensions, this is fine, as long as you can clearly explain why you think this is the case by proper use/analysis of PCA.

<h2><font color="#008000">Before you start...
</font></h2>
Before starting to work on the assignment,
please carefully study the <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/boston.ex.tar.gz">example</a>
I prepared using
the boston database.
Un-tar the file 
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/boston.ex.tar.gz">boston.ex.tar.gz</a> and go to the folder
"BOSTON.EX". <br>
The subfolder "FIGURES" contains all the relevant figures
as eps or gif files.
<br>
Please consult the "boston.read.me" file in BOSTON.EX.<br>

<br>
In the labelling scheme,
concentrate on more than
one coordinate (dimension),
e.g. in the <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/boston.ex.tar.gz">`boston example'</a>,
consider not just the `<u>price</u>' feature,
but run separate experiments
with `<u>per capita crime rate in the town</u>', or 
'<u>pupil-teacher ratio in the town</u>' instead of the 
`<u>price</u>' coordinate).<br>

   

<br><br>
<h2><font color="#008000">Programming language
</font></h2>
There are <B>absolutely no restrictions on</B>  what <B> programming language</B>  shouild be used when doing the assignment. The key is the mathematical model and techniques, not the particular language used to implement them. So feel free to use Matlab, Java, Python, Julia, R, C, ... (you'll need routines to do aigen-decomposition of matrices)
